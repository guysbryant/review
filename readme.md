I had to take an extensive break from learning to code and now that I can
commit the time again, I want to review the core concepts that I've been
taught. I will use this repository to do that.

The main things I want to review: 

Ruby Syntax 

OO Principles 

SQL 

ActiveRecord 

HTML 

CSS

I will do the "final" labs in each of these categories and give myself
a grade on how well I understand the subject matter. Using that I may
decide to move on, do some more labs in that section, or dig into the
subject matter a little more by searching for additional content and/or
experimenting with the concepts in a REPL and/or a small program.

When I reach the end of each of the major sections I will create a project
as I did the first time. This will be a small project meant to meet the
minimum criteria asked by the school. 

I will use this repository for those projects and anything else that might
seem relevant.
